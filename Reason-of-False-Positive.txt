--Auto Update--

Some anti viruses may think it is a IDP.GENERIC or something else
beacause it accsesses programmes in able to upgrade them.
If you are suspicious about it it is a .bat file so you can
look at the code and see it isn't a virus if you don't know
how to code in bat tell someone if you know they can code in it
or look on youtube if it is on there.
